# Word-o-Mouth - an Overview

Word-o-Mouth (WoM) is a website allowing users to save favorite restaurants and allow friends to view these favorites as recommendations. WoM currently allows you to search for venues utilizing the user's geolocation and populate markers of restaurants nearby using Mapbox GL. Users have profiles and can click to view their saved places for quick access to their favorites.

Word-o-Mouth was built with React-Redux on the front end and Express on the backend with a PostgresSQL database utilizing Sequelize as an ORM. WoM uses the Foursquare API to query data and Mapbox GL for its map feature.
